# The Sims 1 Legacy Tips

- How to restore the neighborhoods to their 'unplayed' state.  Caveat: I install my games in a different location than the default location the installer sets aside.

### Restoring the neighborhoods
TS1 Legacy maintains two separate sets of neighborhoods.  One that are pristine copies of the UserData directories. 

The playable neighborhoods can be found at **C:\Users\OWNER_NAME\Saved Games\Electronic Arts\The Sims 25**.  The 'archive' neighborhoods are at (your location will likely differ): **D:\My Games\EA Games\The Sims Legacy**.

Delete the UserData copy from the TS25 directory and copy the original folder from the install directory.  The neighborhood is now reset!

One nice feature of doing this is neighborhood 1 has the opening game tutorial active again!

### Notes
This is a work in progess.  Hopefully I will soon upload TS1 custom content I created years ago that stilll works with the legacy version of TS1.

I have the EA version of the TS Legacy Collection games, Steam has a version as well.  The directory structures appears to be slightly different between the two versions.  Installation and maintainance of the games for the Steam version might be different.
