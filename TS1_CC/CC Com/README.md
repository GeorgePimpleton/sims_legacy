# Custom content (CC) for TS1, Community created
These files are CC I know works in TS1 Legacy.   This is CC created my the Community.

## How to add this custom content to the games, object files
Find you TS1 game install directory.  My game was installed at D:\My Games\EA Games\The Sims Legacy.

Navigate to the Downloads folder.  The Legacy collection will have populated the directory with a lot of sub-folder entries.  This is normal.  Add the CC object files to the Downloads folder.  I dumped all my CC object files into a new sub-directory.  Start the game and you should have the content available in Buy Mode.

## Notes
Not all the content is available to purchase when playing a family.  Some content only shows up when editing an unoccupied or community lot.
