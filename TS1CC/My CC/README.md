#My created custom content (CC) for TS1
These files are CC created object files I made years ago, I know they work in TS1 Legacy.

##How to add this custom content to the games, object files
Find you TS1 game install directory.  My game was installed at D:\My Games\EA Games\The Sims Legacy.

Navigate to the Downloads folder.  Add the CC object files to the Downloads folder.  I dumped all my CC object files into a new sub-directory.  Start the game and you should have the content available in Buy Mode.

##Notes
Not all the content is available to purchase when playing a family.  Some content only shows up when editing an unoccupied or community lot.

Either add the indiviual SC_\* file contents to your game, ***OR*** add SoftwareChefs.far.rar.  All of my custom CC objects are in contained in that single .far file.
