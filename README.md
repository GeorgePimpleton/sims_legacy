# The Sims 1 &amp; 2 Legacy Collections Stuff
Custom Content Files and various tips and tricks about The Sims 1 &amp; 2 Legacy Collections.

### Notes
This is a work in progess.  Hopefully I will soon upload TS1 custom content I created years ago that stilll works with the legacy version of TS1.

I have the EA version of the TS Legacy Collection games, Steam has a version as well.  The directory structures appears to be slightly different between the two versions.  Installation and maintainance of the games for the Steam version might be different.
